# FullStack Counrty Test Task




## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

First you have to move to the BackEnd folder and install dependencies:

```sh
$ cd country-api

$ npm install
```
The project runs on port *4000*, make sure that any other applycation is working on this port.

Use this command to run the server:
```sh
$ node server.js
```

To run the FrontEnd is the same proccess. Move to the coutry-app folder and install al dependencies.
The default port is *3000* :
```sh
$ cd country-app

$ npm install
```
and run it:
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
